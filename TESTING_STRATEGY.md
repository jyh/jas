# UI Verification Strategy

**Status:** decisions locked 2026-06-21. **Relationship to other docs:** this is the
umbrella over `CROSS_LANGUAGE_TESTING.md` (the byte-gate machinery + canonical JSON),
`MANUAL_TESTING.md` (the per-component manual procedure), `OP_LOG.md` (the operation
spine), and `ARCH.md` (the MVC seams). Where those describe *mechanisms*, this describes
*what gets verified at which layer, and why.* A naming note (as everywhere): this is a
**vector illustration application**; we never name a commercial product.

---

## 1. The doctrine

> **The shared *executable artifact* is the byte-truth, gated cross-app. The
> GUI-framework layer is verified per-app or by reference rendering — never as
> cross-app pixels. Only the irreducible residue — anti-aliasing / fonts / gamma,
> framework layout pixels, focus / IME, OS-native chrome, and key→action binding —
> falls to per-app goldens or manual testing.**

Every decision below is the same move: take something currently "verified by eyeballing
five framework renderings" and push it down to a shared, deterministic, byte-comparable
artifact — the way `document_to_test_json` and the operations corpus already work. A
GUI framework (Qt / GTK / AppKit / Dioxus / browser) is treated as an untrusted
*renderer* of a trusted *artifact*, not as a source of truth.

### The layered verification model

| Layer | Instrument | Cross-app byte-gate? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document model | `document_to_test_json` | yes | exists |
| Operations | `op_apply` + `checkpoint_equivalence` | yes | exists |
| Expression evaluation | conformance corpus | yes | exists |
| Tool gestures / input | gesture fixture corpus @ the `CanvasTool` seam | yes | shipped — §5 (10 gestures, 4 apps) |
| Panel / menu / dialog actions | action corpus @ `dispatch_action` / `run_effects` | yes | partial — §5 (1 action; key→action shipped) |
| Canvas drawing | canonical **display list** | yes | decided, unbuilt — §2 |
| Panel widget layout | **Path B** shared layout pass | yes | shipped default-ON — §3 |
| Chrome structure | workspace / menu / toolbar / widget-tree JSON | yes | mostly exists — §4 |
| Per-app pixel residue | per-app raster goldens / geometry introspection | no (intra-app only) | new, gated behind a real bug |
| Irreducible | manual (focus, IME, OS chrome, key binding, visual) | — | the manual floor — §5 |

A property is verified at the **lowest deterministic layer that can express it**. A
screenshot is the instrument of last resort, used only for what no shared artifact can
encode, and then only **per-app** (an app vs. its own past), never cross-app.

---

## 2. Decision A — Canvas sameness = display-list equivalence

**"The canvas drawings look the same" is formally defined as: all apps emit the same
canonical display list — NOT the same pixels.**

The display list is the painter analog of `document_to_test_json`: an ordered,
rasterizer-agnostic vector op stream — path ops (`move`/`line`/`curve` in model coords),
resolved `fill`/`stroke`/`cap`/`join`/`miter`/`dash`/**`fill-rule`**, opacity, a 6-float
affine transform from the shared `Transform` (never the framework matrix), plus
overlay/chrome primitives (selection box, handles, artboard fills/borders/labels/bleed,
tool previews). Every number routes through the existing `_fmt` (4-decimal) and every
color through `_color_json {r,g,b,a}`, so determinism is inherited, not re-earned.

- **Why a display list and not SVG-export diff:** SVG export is a *separate emitter* and
  draws none of the overlays/handles/chrome — it tests the emitter, not the painter. The
  display list captures exactly what the painter draws, including the chrome where
  "looks wrong" bugs live.
- **Why not pixels:** `ARCH.md` line 4-5 — "same observable semantics … not the same
  pixels." Qt / Cairo / CoreGraphics / browser differ in AA, font rasterization, and
  gamma; cross-app pixel parity is impossible *and* undesirable. The residual
  (AA / fonts / gamma) is the legitimate per-platform boundary (`NATIVE_BOUNDARY.md`).

**Build:** document arm reuses `document_to_test_json` (the genuinely byte-identical
serializer — **not** `document_to_svg`, whose existing gate compares parsed-back JSON,
not SVG bytes). Chrome/overlay arm is a thin data-extraction at each draw site (the
geometry — `control_points`, `bounds`, bleed rects — is already computed there). Flask's
canvas already *is* a display list (`engine/canvas.mjs` `renderDocumentLayer` /
`renderSelectionLayer` / `renderOverlayLayer` return SVG strings, incl. overlays).
Prototype the op vocabulary in Python (duck-typed `QPainter` recorder). Defer a true
painter-recorder (gradient/blend/mask pixel capture) until a real overlay bug needs it.

**Residual:** per-app raster goldens (intra-app, never cross-app), gated behind a proven
painter bug, cover the pixel residue.

---

## 3. Decision B — Panel layout via a shared layout pass (Path B)

**Panels render wrong despite identical YAML because the interpreter computes no
geometry** — every app delegates intra-panel widget layout to its framework
(Qt / GTK / AppKit / Dioxus / CSS), including 3+ independent Bootstrap-12
reimplementations. "Same YAML" therefore does not yield same layout; there was never one
layout truth and four followers, only five framework layout engines that happen to look
similar — the exact drift surface the prime directive exists to kill.

**Path B:** introduce a shared, language-neutral **layout pass** that computes widget
rects `(x, y, w, h)` from the panel YAML, consumed by all apps and byte-gated cross-app —
authored in the same style as the expression / `op_apply` / `text_layout` corpora, with a
**stub measure** (e.g. `char_width = 10.0`, exactly as `text_layout` already stubs it) so
it is deterministic. This makes all four panel-bug classes — *widget missing*, *widget
misplaced*, *panel too wide*, *text box too small* — catchable as cross-app DATA instead
of per-app pixels.

- **This is a five-app behavior change.** The canonical box model (padding / margin /
  gap / flex-grow / min-max resolution) becomes truth for Qt / GTK / AppKit / Dioxus
  too, so re-pinning may shift already-shipped panels everywhere. **Gate the box-model
  choice behind a golden-diff review across all five renderers.**
- The shared geometry pass today pins only **pane** edges
  (`test_fixtures/algorithms/pane_geometry.json`, `pane_edge_coord`). The **widget-level**
  pass is the new work; it is the prerequisite for the Flask swap (§6) and the panel
  computed-geometry byte-gate.

---

## 4. Chrome data gates (structure, not pixels)

Panels / menus / toolbar chrome is computed in shared hand-written code, so its *model*
is snapshot-able as data even where its *pixels* are framework-rendered.

- **Panel layout model** — `workspace_to_test_json` already gates resolved pane geometry
  cross-app (`default_layouts.yaml` declares pane rects + dock groups as data). Widen
  fixtures: load each named preset; assert snap targets.
- **Widget presence / kind** — the **canonical widget-kind vocabulary** now exists,
  single-sourced in `workspace_interpreter/widget_tree.py` (`CANONICAL_WIDGET_KINDS`, 37
  kinds) and gated by `widget_kind_coverage_test.py`. The **resolved-widget-tree snapshot**
  is **landed** (`widget_tree(panel, ctx)` → per-widget `{path, type, id, kind, col,
  visible, dyn_visible, bind-keys, style-keys}`), pinned in
  `test_fixtures/algorithms/panel_widget_tree.json` (16 panels, 610 records) and byte-gated
  cross-app in all 4 native apps (sibling of the `panel_layout` corpus; reuses its panels +
  pinned ctx). It closes the *widget-missing* / *wrong-kind* / *wrongly-hidden* classes as
  data — an unknown kind surfaces as a recorded `kind: "placeholder"` (≠ its `type`), and a
  statically-hidden widget as `visible: false`, no pixels needed. Still open: a
  **compile-time** `type:` validator in the compiler, and a per-app *dispatch*-coverage
  assert (the snapshot pins the SHARED resolved tree + vocab; it does not yet record each
  app's own dispatch-table result).
- **Menus / toolbar** — `menu_structure_json` and `toolbar_structure_json` gates exist but
  currently gate **stale mirrors** (see §7). Re-source them from the real menu/toolbar and
  from compiled `menubar.yaml`.

What still needs per-app pixels: final flow *position*, content *fit*, theming colors,
glyph rendering (checkmarks, icons), native popups. These are the layer where logic
regressions almost never originate.

---

## 5. Input injection + the manual floor

**Synthetic input for automated testing is feasible and largely already exists.** The
apps decouple the framework event from the logic, exposing two clean injection seams:

- **(A) the `CanvasTool` state machine** (`on_press` / `on_move` / `on_release` /
  `on_key`) with a stub `ToolContext` — already driven headlessly in every app.
- **(B) `dispatch_action` / `run_effects`** for panel / menu / dialog actions.

The existing operations corpus injects *below* both (at the op level).

**Recommendations, ranked:**

1. A shared cross-language **gesture fixture corpus** at seam A — *capture* real sessions
   rather than hand-author; build the document arm on `document_to_test_json`; eliminate
   float non-determinism by pre-resolving `doc_x`/`doc_y` or quantizing input coords.
2. A shared **action corpus** at seam B — generalize the existing eye-demo +
   `production_route` tests into a corpus.
3. Refactor keyboard / menubar resolution into pure `key→action` functions (today
   framework-fused, ~0 tests).
4. A deterministic hit-test fixture layer (unlocks selection-family gestures).
5. A handful of per-app raw-event smoke tests through a real run loop.

**The manual floor** — what injection (and any shared artifact) fundamentally cannot
verify, kept in the manual suite: raw event + coordinate conversion, real hit-testing
against rendered geometry, key→action / menu-id→command **binding**, focus / tab order /
responder chain, native value-commit semantics, IME / text editing, and visual / overlay /
cursor / theming output. `MANUAL_TESTING.md` should add an explicit "injection floor"
section and a ritual: once a behavior is byte-gated by a shared corpus, retire its manual
cross-app parity test.

---

## 6. Flask re-charter

Flask is **kept**, but **demoted from "the layout/look-and-feel source of truth" to the
thin, non-gating reference renderer of the shared artifacts, plus a render-time genericity
signal.** "Flask's CSS is the truth" was never byte-checkable (it emits flex/Bootstrap and
lets the browser decide rects), which is part of why it drifted.

- Flask becomes a **consumer** of the Path B rects — `renderer.py:474-540` swaps
  flex/Bootstrap emission for absolute-positioned divs at the shared pass's computed rects
  (it already does this for floating panes). **Fed the stub measure**, so the human
  reference and the byte-gate never diverge by browser fonts.
- Flask is **never a pixel/measure oracle** (browser CoreText/HarfBuzz differs from the
  stub and from Qt/Cairo) and **never an interactive-parity target** (the months-long
  `FLASK_PARITY.md` buildout is declined — every recent feature shipped "4 native apps
  only").
- Flask's genericity role is a **render-time signal that complements** the existing static
  lint (`scripts/genericity_check.py`, the `genericity:` job in `.github/workflows/test.yml`)
  — it is not "the enforcer."
- **Exit criterion:** if Path B's box model forces a `renderer.py` rewrite anyway,
  re-evaluate retiring Flask — a ~200-line SVG-from-rects viewer would give the same
  human-viewable reference at far lower maintenance. The reason to keep Flask is that its
  structural shell already exists, so marginal keep-cost is low.

**`develop-first` rule amended.** The old "develop new features in the flask app first"
rule is dead — even spec/structure lands as a shared foundation commit + conformance
corpus, with Flask getting a downstream reshape, because interactive features need the
native document model Flask lacks. Replacement: **author the generic spec and its
cross-language conformance corpus first (language-agnostic, golden-pinned); the native
apps implement against it; Flask consumes it for visual reference; interactive behavior
lands in the native apps.** Native propagation order is unchanged: Rust → Swift → OCaml →
Python. (Reflected in `CLAUDE.md`.)

## 7. Found issues + action items

Surfaced during this analysis; with sequencing.

**Status — verified 2026-06-29 (where each item stands):**
1 ◐ live bug fixed + widget-kind vocabulary gate on `main`
(`jas/panels/widget_kind_coverage_test.py`, 37 canonical kinds, now single-sourced in
`workspace_interpreter/widget_tree.py`; `magic_wand.yaml` tolerance inputs now
`type: number_input`); compile-time validator (`workspace_interpreter/validator.py`)
+ per-app dispatch-coverage assert still open ·
2 ◐ toolbar golden re-sourced + live-gated (13 slots / 29 tools, `has_alternates` + icon);
dblclick options-destination not yet captured ·
3 ✓ menu golden re-sourced (now includes View; 5 menus) ·
4 ◐ **resolved-widget-tree snapshot LANDED** — `widget_tree(panel, ctx)` +
`test_fixtures/algorithms/panel_widget_tree.json` (16 panels, 610 records), byte-gated in
all 4 native apps + Python reference (sibling of `panel_layout`; §4); Flask render-all-panels
CI gate + compile-time `type:` validator + per-app dispatch-coverage assert still open ·
5 ◐ gesture corpus shipped (10 gestures, 4 apps); **action corpus now ~25 actions / 4 apps
across 5 panels** — layers (visibility / lock / outline / new_layer), boolean
(make_compound_shape + union / subtract_front / intersection / exclude), align (all 6 align +
all 8 distribute verbs over two_rects / three_rects), artboards (new_artboard), symbols
(new_symbol). Rust authors the goldens via `generate_action_expected`. Two reusable harness
seams underpin it: (a) **selection-seeding** — a fixture declares `"selection": [[path],…]`,
seeded into `document.selection` via each app's non-undoable writer before dispatch (since
`select_all` is a native `log:` intercept, unreachable through the shared YAML dispatch); (b)
**deterministic id-seeding** — a per-char COUNTER installed into each app's id-mint override so
creation verbs mint a fixed id ("01234567", then "89abcdef", …) byte-identical cross-app, with
production minting unchanged. The corpus surfaced + FIXED SIX real cross-app divergences:
(i) `toggle_all_layers_lock` — Rust dropped its `cascade_lock` (LYR-247); lock is now a
per-element flag with effective-lock-by-inheritance at the read sites; (ii) **align apply** —
converged OCaml/Python from prepend-transform onto BAKE-into-coords (matching Rust/Swift + the
bake-translation design law) and WIRED OCaml's previously-unwired geometric align; (iii)
boolean snap-rounding — Python banker's → half-away-from-zero; (iv) Swift `isRingSimple`
reversed-range crash that had disabled the entire boolean_normalize gate for Swift; (v) OCaml
`Active_document_view.build` exposed no artboard fields, so new_artboard fell back to the
letter default instead of inheriting the current artboard size (a real OCaml production bug);
(vi) Swift's `translated` transform-baked a CompoundShape under align (others recurse operands)
→ fixed to recurse operands + gated (`compound_and_rect.svg`). Python's `translate_element`
also gained the missing Generated arm (it was a no-op → a generated element didn't move under
align; correctness fix, not action-gated since the generated-element SVG round-trip is
deferred). Boolean is exact-vertex at BOTH the action level (`document_to_test_json` pins the
polygon vertices) and the algorithm level (`boolean.json` / `boolean_normalize` upgraded
property→exact, 4 ports bit-identical at IEEE-754). The symbols AND concepts panels are now
fully gated — ALL creation verbs (`new_artboard` / `new_symbol` / `place_instance` /
`place_concept_instance`) gate byte-identically, via a **persistent app-state seam**: a
`[new_symbol, place_instance]` / `[concepts_panel_select, place_concept_instance]` sequence
threads the panel-selected master/concept across the harness's dispatch loop — Rust via
AppState, Swift via model.stateStore, Python via a harness holder, OCaml via one persistent
State_store. The seam work surfaced a consistent cross-app state-store quirk (`set_panel` /
`setPanel` silently no-ops on an un-init_panel-ed scope; the harnesses now init the panel
scope). STILL OPEN: only a separate **pre-existing** Swift `YamlToolArtboardTests.artboardParity`
drag-coordinate divergence (fails on a clean `main`; unrelated to this work — its own latent
bug).
**key→action (rec 3) now DONE** — pure `key_resolver` + `test_fixtures/keys/` corpus gated
in all 4 apps; modifier flags a forward-looking 4-app increment (consistently hardcoded
`false` on the pointer seam today); hit-test fixture (rec 4) folded into the gesture corpus,
no dedicated layer; raw-event smoke tests (rec 5) not started ·
6 ✓ done (MANUAL_TESTING.md: injection-floor section, key-binding/action-effect split,
single-sourced Flask rule, retire-when-gated ritual) ·
7 ✓ Path B render: **default-ON in all 5 apps** (opt OUT with `JAS_PATH_B=0`; opt-in gate
dropped, commit ffbe3e1a) — 12 declarative panels render from the shared pass; the 4
composite panels are **decided permanently native** (sized by the pass, rendered native),
not "stay flex" ·
8 ✓ panel computed-geometry byte-gate **landed in all 4 native apps, all 16/16 panels**
(Path B: `layout_panel` + `test_fixtures/algorithms/panel_layout.json`, byte-exact, **610
rects**; composites as fixed boxes); **render migrations COMPLETE** (Flask → Swift → OCaml →
Python, merged); see PATH_B_DESIGN.md + PATH_B_BOXMODEL_REVIEW.md ·
9 ✓ canonical box model **ratified** (PATH_B_DESIGN.md §2; `char_width=10`); the five-app
sign-off ratified the model + byte-gated rects, not a separate pixel-diff artifact ·
10 ✓ done.

**Ships now (no dependencies):**
1. **Widget-kind vocabulary + coverage gate** — fixes the live bug where `magic_wand.yaml`
   declares tolerance inputs as bare `type: number`, handled by **no app**, so all five
   render a placeholder instead of a number input. Add the vocabulary, the compiler
   validation, and the cross-app coverage assert.
2. **Re-source the stale `toolbar_structure.json` golden** — frozen at 18 tools ending at
   `lasso`; omits magic_wand / ellipse / paintbrush / blob_brush / scale / rotate / shear /
   hand / zoom / eyedropper / artboard. The gate is green only because every app mirrors
   the stale literal. Re-derive each serializer from the real toolbar; add
   `has_alternates`, icon-name id, and dblclick options-destination.
3. **Re-source the drifted `menu_structure.json` golden** — currently `[File, Edit, Object,
   Window]`, missing View, while `menubar.yaml` declares View and all apps build it.
   Re-point to compiled `menubar.yaml`.
4. ~~**Resolved-widget-tree snapshot**~~ **DONE** (`widget_tree` pass + `panel_widget_tree.json`,
   16 panels / 610 records, byte-gated in all 4 native apps + Python). Remaining: the **Flask
   render-all-panels CI gate** (render every panel/dialog from `workspace.json`, fail on
   error/missing-kind) and the **compile-time `type:` validator**.
5. **Input-injection gesture + action corpora** (§5 recs 1–2) — **gesture corpus shipped**
   (10 gestures, gated in all 4 native apps); **action corpus now 5 actions** (layers:
   visibility / lock / outline / new_layer; boolean: `make_compound_shape`), up from 1, gated
   in all 4 apps, with a **selection-seeding harness** (`"selection": [[path],…]` in a fixture,
   seeded via each app's non-undoable writer). Extending it (a) FIXED the
   `toggle_all_layers_lock` divergence (Rust dropped `cascade_lock`; lock is per-element +
   effective-by-inheritance at the read sites) and gated it, and surfaced still-open items:
   (b) `new_artboard` mints a non-deterministic id; (c) **align** needs a 5-app
   apply-mechanism reconciliation (Rust/Swift bake the translate, OCaml/Python prepend a
   transform — bake is correct per the bake-translation design law; OCaml align is also
   unwired); (d) **boolean** needs a shared vertex-normalization gate (the sweep-line ports
   are only property-gated, not exact-vertex). The `ctrl=meta=False` pointer-payload note was
   **mis-scoped**:
   **all four** native apps hardcode `ctrl`/`meta` to `false` on pointer events
   (`yaml_tool.py:304`, `yaml_tool.rs:245`, `YamlTool.swift:275`, `yaml_tool.ml:1344`), and
   all four carry the real flags on the *keyboard* path — so it is a consistent 4-app state,
   not a Python divergence, and no canvas-tool YAML reads pointer `ctrl`/`meta` yet (the only
   `event.meta` consumers are in `artboards.yaml`, a panel-list click at seam B, not the
   pointer seam). Completing the modifiers is therefore a forward-looking **4-app** increment
   (thread the real flags at each framework boundary + a per-app payload test), to do when a
   canvas tool first needs Cmd/Ctrl-click — not a Python-only one-liner. Half-fixing Python
   alone would *create* the cross-app divergence the prime directive exists to prevent.
6. **`MANUAL_TESTING.md` cleanup** — injection-floor section; distinguish key-binding from
   action-effect; single-source the Flask-inclusion rule; retire-manual-parity-when-gated
   ritual.

**Gated on Path B's widget-rect pass existing:**
7. The Flask flex→absolute-div swap (§6).
8. The panel computed-geometry byte-gate.

**Five-app review gate:**
9. The canonical box-model choice (§3) — re-pins shipped panels everywhere.

**Process / hygiene:**
10. The `project_flask_genericity_leaks` memory was a stale-reference false-confidence
    trap (it re-flagged an already-fixed `swatch_libraries` leak). Discipline: re-verify
    any "Flask does X" claim against current code before acting; Flask and its docs lag.

## 8. Open questions

Status updated 2026-06-29 — three of the original six are now resolved by the Path B /
input-injection work.

- ~~**Box model**~~ — **RESOLVED.** Path B canonicalizes Bootstrap/12 columns, wrap
  overflow, weighted `flex:N`, `text = len × char_width` with `char_width = 10`, integer
  round-half-up, and gap / pad / inset from each root's `style.padding`; ratified in
  PATH_B_DESIGN.md §2 and byte-gated (16 panels, 610 rects). Shipped default-ON in all 5 apps.
- **Flask in CI** — *partly decided, not finished.* §6 drops the interactive-parity claim,
  but `engine/README.md` still calls Flask "the fifth implementation" (uncorrected), there is
  no Flask job in `.github/workflows/test.yml`, and the canvas is not wired to an SVG golden.
- ~~**Per-widget rects**~~ — **RESOLVED.** The widget-level pass + corpus
  (`test_fixtures/algorithms/panel_layout.json`, 16 panels) is built and gated in all 4
  native apps. (The earlier "pins only pane edges" statement is superseded.)
- ~~**Gesture corpus determinism**~~ — **RESOLVED** as pre-resolved coords: fixtures store
  `doc_x` / `doc_y` directly as `x` / `y` under the identity-view convention (Model defaults
  are identity → `doc_x == x`), hit-test-free and float-stable by construction.
- **Hit-test fixtures** — *answered differently.* No dedicated `(x,y)→path` fixture layer was
  built; selection-family hit-testing is exercised through the gesture corpus
  (`select_click` / `select_marquee`) driving each app's real bounds-based `hit_test`. A
  standalone portable hit-test table remains an option if a non-gesture case needs it.
- **Text overlay handles** — *still open.* Text selection-bbox / handle coords derive from
  framework-specific glyph metrics; no cross-app fixture or tolerance gate exists yet, so
  they remain per-app residue.
