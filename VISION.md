# Vision — Product & Architecture North Star

This is the durable statement of **where the application is going and why**. It is a
living document: it will change as we learn.

- **`VISION.md` (this file)** — the destination and the architecture that gets us there.
- **`ARCH.md`** — the architecture *as built today*. It currently describes a tree-path,
  immutable-document MVC across the native apps. As the foundations below land, `ARCH.md`
  must be updated to match; where this document and `ARCH.md` disagree, `ARCH.md` is the
  present and this document is the intent.
- Raw vision notes live in `transcripts/AI.md`.

A naming note that applies everywhere: we call this a **vector illustration application**.
We never name a specific commercial product, in code, schema, docs, or fixtures.

---

## 1. The soul: help the artist

We are building a vector illustration application that keeps the ideas artists love about
the classic tools and goes far beyond them. Everything serves one goal:

> **Shorten the distance between what is in the artist's head and what appears on the
> canvas — and keep them in flow while they close it.**

Every beloved feature of the classic tools is really this idea repeated: the Bézier pen
shrank the gap for curves; compound/pathfinder shapes shrank it for complex forms; live
corners shrank it for adjustment. So the test for *anything* — a feature, a fix, a piece of
"more" — is:

> **Does this shrink intention→result, or does it just add surface?**

Alongside it, two non-negotiables of feel: the tool stays **out of the way** (flow:
speed, directness, predictability), and the artist is **fearless** (everything is
reversible; nothing is ever permanent).

---

## 2. The pillars of "more"

1. **Liveness everywhere, by design.** Non-destructive and parametric from the ground up —
   not bolted on. Every shape stays editable back to its intent, forever.
2. **The tool understands intent.** Not generating art *for* the artist, but assisting:
   cleaning and snapping paths, helping with color, and — crucially — understanding
   *semantic relationships*: drag a block and its connectors follow; move one eye and the
   other mirrors; re-pose a standing figure to reach for a flower; change a hand-drawn
   gear's tooth count in one step while keeping technical precision.
3. **Retroactive structuring.** The artist never pre-thinks structure. They draw freely,
   then *declare or infer* meaning late ("this is a gear", "make the teeth editable"),
   non-destructively. We already do this for one case — selecting shapes and combining them
   into a live, releasable compound shape; the vision generalizes that single proven pattern
   to every concept.
4. **Multiple simultaneous interpretations.** The same marks can be *at once* a greeting, a
   tree, and part of a face — overlapping, at different semantic levels. The artist edits
   through one **lens** at a time while the tool keeps the others coherent (or flags an
   honest conflict).
5. **Gestural, conversational flow.** Brainstorm speed with print-ready, CAD-grade output.
   A conversation between the hand and the machine — "Claude Code, but for drawing", where
   traditional skills (sketching, drawing, painting) stay primary and the tool *knows* what
   is being made and helps bring it to life.
6. **Breadth across project types.** Portrait, animation, brochure (professional type and
   print), technical drawing (transmission gears), technical diagram (an architecture
   diagram), and more — each with a short concept→creation distance, fast revisions, liveness
   everywhere, and deep technical control without the burden of constant tool/panel switching.

---

## 3. The engineering values (non-negotiable)

- **Equivalence by spec, exactly.** Built as five implementations — `jas_flask` (the generic
  reference renderer), `jas_dioxus` (Rust), `JasSwift` (Swift), `jas_ocaml` (OCaml), `jas`
  (Python) — all equivalent at the `five-port-parity` tag; the live enforcement now spans the
  active ports (Rust, Swift) plus the `workspace_interpreter/` reference, with the frozen
  ports preserved at the tag (`POLICY.md` §1). "Exactly the same" means **same observable
  semantics** — same element tree, same state transitions, same resolved widget/element
  properties, same algorithm results — **not same pixels** (platforms render differently,
  and that is correct).
- **Minimize manual testing** — it is the most expensive part of development.
- **A common specification** — behavior is expressed once, in `workspace/*.yaml`, and
  interpreted by all apps. Native code is discouraged.
- **High performance, scalable to massive drawings** (we expect 100k–1M elements eventually).
- **Clean, factored code** following good software-engineering practice, in all languages.
- **Built to grow and change** — features will be added and reworked continuously.

## 4. The central reconciliation

The most important idea in this document:

> **Equivalence (five identical apps) and the AI-assisted vision are not in tension. They are
> the same architecture, seen twice.** Every abstraction we build to keep the five apps
> identical is exactly the abstraction an agentic AI needs; every layer we build for the
> artist is what we pin for equivalence. There is one road, not a fork.

Two corollaries:

- **Don't chase features; pin the interpreter.** A feature is `workspace/*.yaml` interpreted
  by a thin engine. Pin the handful of interpreter layers with shared, CI-gating conformance
  tests, and every feature built on them is identical *by construction*.
- **A gate is only worth having if it runs, fails loudly, and is watched.** (The cross-language
  algorithm harness silently sat dead-but-green in CI for seven weeks; see the
  near-term backlog in §11.)

---

## 5. The architecture, converged

The ten design directions (§6) reduce to a small set of compounding foundations. Each pays
off for many goals at once.

1. **A deterministic core with one operation vocabulary.** The action/effect vocabulary (the
   `workspace/actions.yaml` operations) is the *single* way the document changes. The AI, a
   gesture, a panel, and a future collaborator are all just *producers* of the same
   operations. No privileged mutation path.
2. **Stable element identity + a live dependency graph — the keystone.** *(Foundation SHIPPED
   2026-06; see §6.2.)* Identity is now path **and** id: the tree-path stays the UI address,
   and an additive `common.id` is the stable "which element" handle. Liveness is no longer only
   *containment*-based — a `Reference` element names its inputs by id, giving **reference-based,
   many-to-many** edges and a true dependency graph with incremental + cached recompute. This
   one change unlocks liveness, cross-tree relationships, multiple interpretations, versioning,
   comments, and collaboration — most of which (everything past the graph itself) remain to be
   built on top of the now-laid foundation.
3. **Concepts as declarative data packs.** A concept (gear, eye, connector, hatch, …) is
   *data*, not native code: a **fitter** (raw selection → parameters/roles — the "promote"
   that is the dual of today's `release`/`expand`), a **generator** (parameters → geometry),
   **operations** (its edit verbs), and **constraints** (its invariants). This is the same
   native→data migration already proven for tools.
4. **One seam, reused three times: native capture / shared semantics / pinned-at-the-boundary.**
   Interaction (native gesture recognition → normalized event → shared handler), rendering
   (shared cull/LOD decisions → native paint), and AI (canonical perception → shared plan →
   native-agnostic execution) all use the same boundary. Pin the normalized middle; let the
   edges be native.
5. **The operation log is the spine.** *(Foundation SHIPPED 2026-06, all four native apps;
   see §10 item 2 / `OP_LOG.md`.)* The transaction history is simultaneously undo/redo,
   the replay-test fixtures, the AI's action surface, and the versioning/collaboration
   substrate. Versioning, comments, collaboration, and the AI are all "history and
   participants over an identified, operation-based document."
6. **Two testing regimes** (see §9) that triple as the equivalence guarantee, the enabler of
   safe incremental optimization, and the mechanism that *deletes* manual testing.
7. **"Keep-it-ready" deferrals.** Two large axes — **animation** (time as a graph input) and
   **collaboration** (mergeable operations) — are not built now, but the core is kept ready
   for them (cheap now, expensive to retrofit). See §6.8 and §6.9.
8. **Artist primacy as an enforced, tested invariant** (§6.10) — not a guideline.

The recurring shape: **the document is always a *source description evaluated against a
context*, never a baked snapshot.** That single discipline is what makes liveness,
time-readiness, and equivalence all possible.

---

## 6. The ten design directions

Each is summarized with its idea, where we stand today (grounded in the code), the benefit,
and the honest downside/dependency.

### 6.1 Deterministic core + advisory AI layer
The AI never *is* the source of truth; it proposes deterministic operations on a deterministic
core, which executes and is fully pinned. The AI is centralized (one shared brain), never in
the synchronous draw path, and the core is fully usable with it switched off.
**Today:** the operation vocabulary, a portable document serialization (`test_json`), the
per-app effects engines, **and now the typed transaction journal** (§10 item 2 / `OP_LOG.md`)
already exist — the deterministic-operation surface an agent commits through is largely in
place. AI integration itself is greenfield. **Benefit:** equivalence survives (you test the *operation the AI committed*,
not the model); AI cost/complexity paid once. **Downside:** offline/latency story required; a
clean operation-API boundary must be held; depends on 6.2.

### 6.2 Stable identity + the live relationship graph — the keystone
Generalize liveness from owned-children to elements referenced by stable id, anywhere in the
document; build the dependency DAG with incremental recompute. **Today (SHIPPED 2026-06, all
four native apps — see `REFERENCE_GRAPH.md` / `SYMBOLS.md`; `jas_flask`'s JS engine is a
separate port outside this rollout):** an additive `common.id` exists on every
element (tree-paths kept for the UI); `LiveVariant` now has two arms (`CompoundShape` +
`Reference`), where a `Reference` names its target by id and resolves through an
`ElementResolver` seam; a derived `DependencyIndex` (`deps`/`rdeps`/`dangling`/`cycles`/
`topo_order`, with a cross-language-locked Kahn ordering) is a pure function of the document;
recompute is now both incremental (persistent id→element index, O(changed) maintenance) and
cached (a generation-epoched reference-geometry cache), each held to a from-scratch ==
incremental debug-assert gate; cycles/dangling break to empty at eval; identity round-trips
via SVG `id`/`<use>`; and Symbols (reusable masters + live instances) ride the same machinery.
**Benefit:** unlocks essentially the whole intent vision at once. **Still ahead:** write-time
cycle rejection (eval-time break already handles imported cycles); importing *foreign* `<use>`
as live vs. flattening; and bidirectional **constraint solving** (IK, mutual constraints) —
the one-way DAG covers most cases but constraint solving is a separate, harder layer.

### 6.3 Domains as declarative packs
Concepts (fitter + generator + operations + constraints) ship as data, interpreted identically
by all apps; breadth becomes content, not releases — authorable by the team, the community, or
the AI. **Today:** tools already migrated native→data (all but Type/TypeOnPath); the expression
language can **generate geometry** (`sin`/`cos`/`tan` degrees, `pow`, `range`, `fold`, pinned
across five apps); and the **concept-pack format + generator engine have shipped** — a concept is
a `workspace/concepts/*.yaml` (`params` + a generator expression → geometry), pinned by its own
cross-language conformance corpus (`CONCEPTS.md`; `regular_polygon`, `spiral`, `star`, and the
flagship `gear` ride it — with `mod`/`floor` added to the language for the gear/star parity). A
parametric concept is now data, **the gear included**. **Remaining, in dependency order:** the
document `LiveVariant::Generated` instance arm; operations; the fitter (`promote`); and a
**constraint representation**. **Benefit:** N domains
cost ~one engine, propagated to the active apps for free (frozen ports hold the tag-era packs). **Downside:** the fitter and a deterministic
(no-JS) constraint representation are still unbuilt; the generator engine is corpus-pinned, so
each addition stays safe.

### 6.4 Liveness as the bridge between brainstorm-speed and CAD-precision
A gesture produces a *live operation with inferred parameters*; the panel later tunes the same
parameters without redoing anything. The fast path and the precise path are **the same
operation at two times**, not two tools. **Today:** tools are already declarative handlers over
a normalized pointer payload, and preview-then-commit exists (e.g. the ellipse tool). The gap:
the event vocabulary is mouse-only (no gestures/pressure as first-class); promotion and "lenses"
are not generalized. **Benefit:** speed *and* precision; panels stay for depth without burdening
flow. **Downside:** "promotion" and mode/lens UX are subtle; gesture discoverability needs care.
The unifying elegance: one operation vocabulary, three input channels (gesture, menu, AI) — which
simultaneously gives discoverability (menu fallback), equivalence (the menu path is spec-able),
and AI integration (same op).

### 6.5 Two testing regimes (see §9)
Deterministic conformance for the core; perceptual/AI evaluation for the creative frontier.
Manual testing converges to a bounded, prioritized sample — and even manual sessions get
captured as replay fixtures so they are paid for once.

### 6.6 Performance is co-equal with liveness (see §8)
Incremental evaluation, spatial indexing, and dirty-region rendering must be designed in as
hooks now (even with simple implementations), because they are structural, not bolt-ons.

### 6.7 The AI operation-API + canvas perception
Make "Claude Code for drawing" concrete: tool schemas generated from `actions.yaml`; perception
via *structural* query (scoped subgraph) **and** *visual* raster (vision model); an agentic loop
of perceive → plan a transaction → **live preview** → self-critique → artist accepts/tweaks.
The key difference from coding: review happens **before** commit (liveness preview), and the
artist — not a test oracle — is the judge of "good". **Today:** greenfield, but built on 6.1.
**Benefit:** reuses everything; the AI and a human collaborator become the same thing.
**Downside:** vision of fine vector detail is imperfect; reviewability of large transactions
needs semantic summaries; perceive from a *canonical* render so plans stay uniform across apps.

### 6.8 Animation — keep it ready, don't build it yet
Keyframed/procedural animation is "liveness over time": add a global `t` to the evaluation
context and a timeline structure, and the incremental graph handles playback. Simulation
(recurrence) and rigging/IK (constraint solving × time) are separate hard layers.
**The one discipline to hold now:** keep edit-time (undo/history) and playback-time (the
animation cursor) cleanly separate, and never bake frame state into the document. Then animation
is additive, not a rewrite. **Today:** greenfield; the source-evaluated-against-context shape
that makes this free is already present.

### 6.9 The ecosystem — identity is the keystone here too
The operation log makes **versioning** nearly free (a version is a labeled point in the op
stream; semantic diffs via the AI) — build this early; it delivers the "fast client revisions"
goal. **Comments-on-objects** need stable ids. **Collaboration** = merging operation streams
(the AI is just another participant) — strategically the highest-value ecosystem item, but a
large axis: keep the op model merge-ready now, build later. **Interop:** export = `expand`
(bake to flat SVG/PDF), import = `promote` (fit structure) — but fix serialization fidelity
first (see §11). **Color/type/print** are more mature than expected (CMYK, ICC, rendering
intent, overprint, print pipeline already exist) — remaining work is completeness, scoped by
target domain.

### 6.10 Artist primacy as an enforced law
Operationalized as invariants, not vibes: **(a)** reversibility is absolute — every operation,
the AI's most of all, is undoable and the original recoverable (a cross-language `undo_redo_laws`
fixture already exists — extend it); **(b)** the AI *proposes*, never commits unbidden, through
the same gate as any operation; **(c)** every AI action is legible as named operations in the
artist's own vocabulary, with semantic summaries; **(d)** the artist is the aesthetic oracle —
the AI verifies objective constraints but never decides "good"; **(e)** skill stays primary —
direct manipulation is always fully capable alone; the AI removes drudgery, not artistry.
Because the AI has no mutation path except proposing transactions through the gate, **primacy is
enforced by construction and verifiable in CI** — impossible to violate, not merely discouraged.
The artist can *dial up* delegation by explicit, revocable consent, but autonomy is granted,
never assumed. The AI is a **gap-shrinker** between conception and creation — never an
intention-substituter.

---

## 7. Buildable vs. frontier (be honest)

**Buildable on the foundations:**
- Parameter-driven concepts (the gear's tooth count); param + generator.
- Forward reference-propagation relationships (connectors follow blocks; mirrored eyes; FK posing).
- Multiple membership + hierarchy (overlapping/nested concept overlays over shared atoms).
- Keyframed/procedural animation; versioning; comments; deterministic fitters (curve-fit, boolean, repeat detection).

**Frontier (AI-assisted, must degrade gracefully — propose, surface conflicts, let the artist arbitrate):**
- Fuzzy semantic fitting of messy hand-drawing ("this is a gear/eye").
- Style-preserving regeneration (change tooth count while keeping the hand-drawn character).
- Constraint *negotiation* across competing interpretations ("fuller tree" vs. "legible greeting").
- Inverse kinematics / rigging; physical simulation.

The product ships the buildable tier with crisp, deterministic mechanisms and lets the AI tier
grow underneath **without changing the artist's flow** — the experience is the same whether the
fitter is a geometric heuristic or a model.

---

## 8. Scale philosophy

- **Distinguish logical complexity (document elements) from visual complexity (painted
  primitives).** They scale differently. The concept architecture (6.3) converts potential
  logical explosion into cheap visual complexity: the AI should **generate parametric structure,
  not flattened primitives** — a forest is a generator over a tree concept, not 500k shapes —
  so the model stays small and complexity is materialized lazily at render time.
- **AI changes the arrival rate of complexity** (and we may not see it coming) — so the
  performance *hooks* must exist early even if the implementations stay simple.
- **The incremental path:** clean interfaces make implementations swappable (linear scan →
  grid → R-tree; full recompute → incremental subgraph) with zero caller changes. The
  conformance harness (§9) is what makes each swap *safe* — it proves the faster implementation
  is behaviorally identical. Simple implementations must **degrade, not break**, under surprise
  scale; **telemetry** must report when budgets are approached.
- **Optimization is per-app; behavior is uniform.** Add the heavy index only in the app under
  scale pressure; equivalence holds because the harness pins the result.
- **Determinism traps to respect:** recompute order must derive from stable ids (not
  language-specific hashmap order); avoid non-deterministic parallel floating-point in the
  pinned path.

---

## 9. Testing philosophy

Three regimes; push everything as far *down* as possible (cheaper, cross-platform, CI-friendly):

1. **Deterministic conformance** — `(state, op)→state'`, expression evaluation, geometry and
   algorithms, liveness recompute (`incremental == from-scratch`), the resolved render-*tree*,
   generators. This regime *is* the equivalence harness.
2. **Capture / replay** — record the seam: an AI plan, a gesture, or a whole session becomes a
   deterministic fixture replayed across all apps. **Our 36 manual-test transcripts
   (`transcripts/*_TESTS.md`) are already scripted action sequences with coordinates and
   Do/Expect — adding session capture turns them into executable, cross-app regression
   fixtures, so each manual session is paid for once.** (No capture/replay recorder exists yet;
   this regime is unbuilt. Manual passes are currently Rust-only in practice.)
3. **Perceptual / evaluative** — the irreducible frontier: "is the AI plan good?", "does it look
   right?", "does the gesture feel right?" Eval datasets, golden images (per-platform, sparingly),
   LLM-as-judge (calibrated), and a *bounded* human sample.

Disciplines: keep live model calls out of the merge gate (use recorded outputs); run AI quality
eval as a separate periodic metric gated on prompt/model changes; prefer render-tree conformance
over pixel baselines; tier CI (fast deterministic gate on every change; slower eval/perf/visual
tracks periodically) so heavy testing never fights iteration speed.

---

## 10. Critical path

Everything stands on three things — build them first:

1. **Stable element identity** — ✅ **SHIPPED** (additive `common.id` in all four native apps; coexists
   with tree-paths; round-trips via SVG `id`; duplicate clears id, undo/redo preserve it).
2. **The operation / transaction log** — ✅ **SHIPPED** (Increments 1–3 across all four native
   apps, merged to `main`; see `OP_LOG.md`). The atomic, reversible, summarizable unit is built:
   a runtime `op_apply`, a typed `Transaction` journal (`op_journal` + `journal_head`) layered
   *co-equally* over the snapshot stacks, the enforced `set_document` chokepoint (the
   consolidation of §11), the **mandatory `checkpoint_equivalence` gate** (replay == snapshot,
   byte-identical), the 33-verb `actions.yaml`↔`op_apply` unification, per-frame drag coalescing,
   id-primary addressing (3c-1), the runtime layout-op dispatcher (3d), and sibling-app
   production routing so *every* app's gestures journal — not just Rust's. **Still ahead:**
   capture/replay sessions (§9 regime 2 — the highest-value follow-on), journal persistence, and
   collaboration (op-inversion, `doc_id`, recorded-merge — 3c-2/3/4), all deliberately deferred
   but kept format-ready.
3. **The expression-language conformance corpus** — ✅ **SHIPPED as a cross-language gate.**
   `workspace/tests/expressions.yaml` is compiled to `test_fixtures/expressions/conformance.json`
   and self-checked in all four native apps **plus** the Python reference, CI-gated (with a
   freshness check). The closure lexical-scoping divergence it was meant to pin is fixed in OCaml
   **and** Rust — the gate immediately caught a second leak a manual survey had missed.
   **Geometry generators now ship on top of it** — `sin`/`cos`/`tan` (degrees), `pow`, `range`,
   `fold`, pinned by the corpus across all five interpreters — so the next critical-path item is
   the **concept-pack format + constraint representation** (6.3).

The live dependency graph (6.2 — ✅ shipped) and the operation-log spine (§5 item 5 / §10 item 2
— ✅ shipped) are both in. The open chain, in dependency order: the rest of the concept-pack system (6.3 —
the format + generator engine ship and the gear/star flagship is data; remaining are the document
`Generated` instance arm, operations, the fitter, and constraints) → capture/replay sessions
(§9 regime 2, now unblocked by the journal) and the gesture/lens layer (6.4) → the AI operation
API and perception (6.1/6.7) → versioning (6.9). Animation (6.8) and collaboration (6.9) stay
deferred-but-ready throughout.

---

## 11. Near-term runway (clearing the equivalence backlog)

The 2026-06-13 codebase review produced a prioritized backlog whose equivalence-pinning items are
direct prerequisites for this vision. The most relevant:

- **Restore the cross-language algorithm harness** so the lead implementation is actually
  verified (done, then it **silently re-broke** when Phase-4b put `IdIndex` in the web-gated
  `canvas::render` and core `model.rs` imported it — `--no-default-features` stopped compiling;
  re-fixed 2026-06 by moving the index into core `document::id_index`; `algorithm_roundtrip`
  418/0, commutativity 192/0). **Lesson, still open:** there is no fast unit-stage
  `cargo build --no-default-features` guard, so a web-into-core leak surfaces only deep in the
  cross-language CI job. Add that guard.
- **Fix canonical-serialization fidelity** (CompoundShape and per-range tspans were silently
  dropped) — ✅ **done**: CompoundShape and per-range tspans now round-trip through JSON,
  binary, and SVG, pinned by the shared cross-language harness.
- **Build the expression-language conformance corpus and fix closure-scope divergence** — the
  prerequisite for concept packs (6.3). ✅ **done**: the corpus is now a cross-language gate (all
  four native apps + the Python reference self-check the same compiled cases in CI, with a
  freshness check), and the closure lexical-scoping divergence is fixed and pinned in **both**
  OCaml and Rust.
- **Consolidate to one mutation path** (Rust formerly had two effect runners: `renderer.rs`
  on `AppState`, `effects.rs` on `StateStore`/`Model`) — ✅ **done**: all mutation now funnels
  through the enforced `set_document` chokepoint (the `in_txn` assertion) in all four native
  apps — the prerequisite that made the op-log journal complete-by-construction (`OP_LOG.md`
  Increment 1). Artist primacy (6.10) is now architecturally enforced at this seam.
- **Add the widget/effect parity guard and validator cross-reference layer** — ⬜ not done;
  catches whole classes of five-app divergence cheaply.

---

## 12. Keeping this document and `ARCH.md` honest

- `ARCH.md` describes the system as built; update it whenever a foundation in §5 lands (in
  particular, when stable identity, the live graph, or the concept-pack runtime ship). Its
  implementation table now carries the post-freeze port statuses (`POLICY.md` §1).
- This document changes when the *intent* changes. Decisions made here (e.g. the keep-ready
  deferrals, artist-primacy invariants) should be cited when they constrain implementation work.
